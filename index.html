    <h1> About Me</h1>
    
    <h2>Hello, i'm Sydney. </h2>  
    <p>
    I am a designer and web developer living in Calgary, AB.
    Three years ago, mid Covid I moved to Calgary to study at Alberta University of the Arts. 
    Between my third and fourth year I caught a show in <em>The Illingworth Kerr Gallery</em> on a whim. It was a collection of work themed around AI, machine learning, surveillance, and ethical tech problems. Here I was introduced to how art and technology could come together. I was hooked, and it completely changed my process and my focus. 
    I was featured in three public art shows in Calgary between 2022 and 2023 where I was prominently mixing art and computer tech in my work. The success of these projects led to my winning the Board of Governors Graduating Student Award in 2023. 
      
    Moving forward I am still combining art and tech in creating responsive, well-designed web pages. I love learning new things and experimenting. When I'm not in school, I'm working on personal projects and illustrations, or perfecting my crochet techniques. 
    If you have a web problem that requires a creative solution, reach out! I am actually very cool.
