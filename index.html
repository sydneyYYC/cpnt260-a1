    <h1> About Me</h1>
    
    <h2>Hi, I'm Sydney!</h2>  

  <p>
    I am a designer and web developer based in Calgary, AB.
    Three years ago I moved to Calgary from Ontario for my BFA at Alberta University of the Arts. 
    During my studies I caught a show in <em>The Illingworth Kerr Gallery</em> on a whim. It was a collection of work themed around AI, machine learning, surveillance, and ethical tech usage. Here I was introduced to how art and technology could come together. I was hooked, and it completely changed my process and my focus. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Between 2022 and 2023 I was featured in three public art shows where I was prominently mixing art and computer tech in my work. The success of these projects led to winning the Board of Governors Graduating Student Award in 2023. 
  </p>

   <p>  
    Moving forward I am still combining art and tech in creating responsive, well-designed web pages. I love learning new things and experimenting. When I'm not working on coding, I'm working on perfecting my crochet techniques. 
    If you have a web problem that requires a creative solution, reach out! I am actually very cool.
